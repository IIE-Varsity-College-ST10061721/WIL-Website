        <p>
            Our mission is to better the world through kindness to animals by assisting rescuers with food and
            supplies, allowing them to focus on their rescue work. We aim to inspire others to adopt rather than
            to shop, network animals in need of forever homes, and encourage everyone to help furballs in need.
